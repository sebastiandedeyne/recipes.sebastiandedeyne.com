# Onion rings

- 1 large onion

Cut onion into 1/4-inch slices. Separate the slices into rings, and set aside.

- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt

In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt. Dip the onion slices into the flour mixture until they are all coated; set aside.

- 1 egg
- 1 cup milk
- Sweet paprika

Whisk the egg and milk into the flour mixture using a fork. Add sweet paprika. Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat, then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping. The wire rack may be placed over a sheet of aluminum foil for easier clean up.

- 3/4 cup dry bread crumbs

Spread the bread crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish. Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat. Give it a hard tap as you remove it from the crumbs. The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings.

Deep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove to paper towels to drain.
